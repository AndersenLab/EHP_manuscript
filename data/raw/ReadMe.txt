a) File ICE_Acute_Oral_Toxicity

I removed all data except LD50. Keep in mind, modifier < or > means there was either effects below or above the test dose(s)

In vivo and in silico data compiled by NICEATM that describe toxic effects occurring within a few hours of one or more oral doses of a test substance within a 24-hr period. Includes data on mixtures and active ingredients.

b) File ICE_Acute_Dermal_Toxicity

I removed all data except LD50. Keep in mind, modifier < or > means there was either effects below or above the test dose(s)

In vivo data that describe toxic effects occurring within a few hours of a single dose of a test substance applied to the skin. Includes data on mixtures and active ingredients.

c) File ICE_DART

Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity (DART)

Data from in vivo DART regulatory guideline assays used to evaluate effects that a chemical may have to the reproductive system or to the developing organism toxic and teratogenic effects that occur when a substance is administered to an animal during gestation. Learn more	

Removed all data except LOEL


3) Rat TEST model predictions - acute oral toxicity

Go here: https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/batch-search
Drop in list of chemical CAS
Then export TEST model predictions
We can do this together with the final CAS list of C elegans

4) Zebrafish Folder

Subfolder Su et al 2021
Use their xlsx file FET-LC50 values

file: annex2_fet_en.xlsx

Use tab ZFET for final AFT comparison. Need to use summary lowest regression column

--- For zebrafish we should also be using Padilla or Tanguay data
