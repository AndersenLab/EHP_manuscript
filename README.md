# EHP_manuscript
This repository holds data and code to reproduce analyses from the "High-Throughput Toxicity Testing with C. elegans: Current Platforms, Key Advantages, and Future Directions" manuscript.

## Usage
* Open the `01_data_processing.R` script in Rstudio.
    * Run the code to see how the raw data are cleaned, formatted, and joined.
* Open and run the reaming `.R` files sequentially to reproduce the analyses in the paper.
* The `functions.R` code contains all the orthogonal regression functions to compare across species and platforms and plot results.
